## Inspiration

## Motivation

I don't want to write the same boring dataloaders all over again
I just want to be able to transform cool ideas in to code. 

Will probably use this in the course "Pattern Recognition" at Waseda 

## Structure

### model.py

Contains *ONLY* your model


### train.py

Entry point. here we just mix everything and run it all 


### detect.py

TODO: must be implemented before anything else 

### config.py

Contains all hyperparameters
And yes, we're using a python file and not yaml 

### data 

Folder to store your train, test and val images

### utils/helpers.py

Annoying code you need to get up and running

### utils/visuals.py

Don't ask me, I am not a data scientist or analyst
Some cool plotting goes into here 

### datasetup.py

Set up and install your data inside here

### eval.py

Run your own data here to only test


##  Requirements

1. You should have torch torchvision matplotlib, numpy and tqdm installed
2. TK, qt or some way of showing matplotlib
3. It's better to run with NVIDIA!
